# Learningshala CMS - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the Learningshala CMS! (It was supposed to go live on Learningshala or Skollege)

## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for the Courses and Universities CMS built for Learningshala. It utilizes **Strapi**, a powerful headless CMS, to manage content efficiently. This backend repository can help with scaling headless CMS with SEO optimised content and then later converted to full fledged product too as per the changing needs to provide personalised experience to end users.

## Background

We were the technology firm that built the entire CMS for Learningshala (Complete Design & Development). Unfortunately, the payment for our work was not completed by the co-founders, Devesh Singh and Aashish Singh. To promote transparency and contribute to the community, we decided to open source this project.

## Technology Stack

- **Strapi**: A flexible, open-source headless CMS that makes it easy to manage and distribute content.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing content and configurations.
